ehcache::client is a Ruby client for the ehcache cache, operating in client server mode.

It uses an ehcache server running somewhere on the network. That ehcache server can be
part of a cluster, for redundancy, if desired. In that case a load balancer should be used
 in between ehcache::client and the server.

Usage semantics are similar to the ruby memcached client.
