Evaluation FAQ

 See the {{{/documentation/faq.html}FAQ}} for general FAQ questions. These ones are Q and A geared towards those evaluating
 Ehcache for inclusion in production applications.


* I understand Ehcache is available as both an open source project and as a commercially supported Enterprise Ehcache product. Which one should I use?

   The Ehcache open source project is a great choice for developers and for less critical production deployments, however many of the most successful users of Ehcache choose to deploy in production with Enterprise Ehcache – Terracotta’s commercial product offering


* How does the commercial Enterprise Ehcache product differ from the Ehcache open source project?
  

  Enterprise Ehcache is built on the core open source technology, but is augmented with value-added features targeted for production use. Enterprise Ehcache comes in a series of editions that are hardened, tested, and qualified on multiple production environments, delivered with commercial licensing, indemnification, and backed by SLA-driven support contracts.

  See the attached {{{/EhcacheBrochure.pdf}product brochure}} for more information.

  For a detailed description of Enterprise Ehcache, see {{{http://www.terracotta.org/echache} terracotta.org/ehcache}}.


* What are the software licenses used?
  
  See {{{/license} ehcache.org/license}}.
