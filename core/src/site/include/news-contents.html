      <h4>11 July 2011: Ehcache 2.5 Beta 1 Released</h4>
	    <p>The major new capability of Ehcache 2.5 is enhanced cache
	       resource management, specifically the ability to set the maximum
	       size in bytes of a Cache or CacheManager. This offers the
	       following additional benefits to Ehcache users:</p> 
	    <ul> 
	      <li><strong>Ease of use.</strong> Tuning cache sizes is now as simple as setting the maximum number of bytes.  No more setting maximum entry counts and juggling eviction parameters to approximate the maximum amount of system memory your cache can use.</li>
	      <li><strong>Greater efficiency.</strong> Ehcache now efficiently manages caches based on their memory footprint and can dynamically balance their resource use based on runtime size information.</li>
	    </ul>

  <h4>15 February 2011: Ehcache Search Released</h4>
  <p>Ehcache Search is an addition to the core Ehcache API that lets you query, search and analyze billions of cache entries in memory, with results to complex searches returned in less than a second. By querying the cache directly, you can avoid the time-consuming and expensive process of querying the database, then mapping query results to cache lookups.</p>

  <h4>2 February 2011: Ehcache User Survey</h4>
  <p>The results of a comprehensive survey of Ehcache users are now available in
     a paper entitled "Caching Use Cases in the Enterprise: What You Can Learn
     from Hundreds of Ehcache Users Across the Globe."</p>
  <p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>The overwhelming majority – 75 percent – of the survey respondents
      would like to implement a distributed cache to meet their expanding
      data and performance needs in the next 12-18 months.</li>
    <li> Using more memory – simply and effectively – is a key driver.  43
      percent of respondents have servers with 32GB or more of RAM and 11
      percent were over 64GB.  41 percent reported splitting up their data
      sets and stacking their JVMs to avoid garbage collection issues.  73
      percent want to use technology such as BigMemory to remove heap size
      limitations.</li>
    <li>Distributed cache usage will encompass a wide range of
      industries and company sizes. Financial Services, Telco, Healthcare,
      eCommerce, Gaming and Government stand out as the most demanding in
      terms of performance, latency and reliability.</li>
    <li>Distributed caching prospects from the survey use a mix
      technology of open source and commercial stacks including Tomcat,
      Hibernate, Spring and Oracle Fusion.</li>

  <h4>9 November 2010: BigMemory for Ehcache GA</h4>
  <p>
      BigMemory is an add-on to Enterprise Ehcache that permits caches to use an additional type of memory store
      outside the object heap. This off-heap store, which is not subject to Java GC, is 100 times faster than the
      DiskStore and allows very large caches to be created in memory (we have tested this up to 350GB).
  </p>
  <p>

<div class="section"><h4>20 July 2010: Ehcache 2.2 and Enterprise Ehcache 2.2 released</h4>
  <p>Ehcache 2.2 and Enterprise Ehcache 2.2 have been released.  The new
     capabilities in this latest version of Ehcache are focused on improving
     the scalability, visibility, and management of the Terracotta-backed
     distributed cache for Ehcache. Enterprise Ehcache 2.2
     enables customers to store over a terabyte  of data and hundreds of
     millions of entries in a single cache.  Designed to be a 
     snap-in capability, this new terabyte-scale storage option can be turned
     on with a simple change to the ehcache configuration file.</p>
  <p>New in Ehcache 2.2:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Visibility and Control—Simplified and improved Ehcahe management
        console for distributed caches.</li>
    <li>New Common Runtime Library—Reduces memory usage and network connections
      and provides new common developer constructs; it also exposes an API
      that programmers can use alongside the Ehcache API to perform complex
      inter-process coordination tasks across multiple machines with just a
      few lines of code.</li> 
  </ul>
  <p>New in Enterprise Ehcache 2.2: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Scale and Performance—New storage option for Ehcache that supports
        terabyte scale, radically decreases memory usage and increases the
        addressable cache size tenfold.</li>  
    <li>Authentication and Authorization—Added Java Authentication and
        Authorization Service (JAAS) support provides LDAP authentication
        support for tight integration to corporate user management
        systems.</li> 
    </ul>

<div class="section"><h4>17 May 2010: Ehcache Monitor 1.0 released<a
        name="a17_May_2010:_Ehcache_Monitor_1.0_released"></a></h4>

    <p>This add-on tool for Ehcache provides enterprise-class monitoring and management
        capabilities for use in both development and production. It is intended to help
        understand and tune cache usage, detect errors, and provide an easy to use
        access point to integrate with production management systems. It also provides
        administrative functionality such as the ability to forcefully remove items from
        caches.</p>

    <p>Note: Ehcache Monitor is not open source. It is available free for development
        use but must be licensed for production use. A production license is provided as
        part of the <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.terracotta.org/ehcache/">commercial
            versions</a> of Ehcache, either DX, EX or FX.</p>

    <p>Simply install the Monitor on an Operations server, add the Monitor Probe jar to
        your app, add a few lines of config in ehcache.xml and your done.</p>

    <p>See the <a href="./documentation/monitor.html">documentation</a> for Ehcache
        Monitor, including a usage video from Ehcache founder Greg Luck, or download <a

            name="a17_May_2010:_Ehcache_2.1.0_and_new_ehcache-nonstopcache_and_ehcache-unlockedreadsview_betas_released"></a>
</h4>

    <p>Ehcache 2.1.0 rounds out Ehcache 2.0. JTA support has been added for standalone
        ehcache. JTA for Hibernate has been added which now means Ehcache supports
        <i>all</i>
        Hibernate strategies. ehcache-nonstopcache adds a new API with support for
        timeouts on Cache Operations and configurable actions on disconnection from a
        cluster. ehcache-unlockedreadsview adds support for a coherent cache to expose
        an unlocked view at the same time, for rapid response.</p>

    <p>The maturity and depth of the integration between Ehcache and Terracotta server
        is now such that, for distributed caching, the two best way to use each
        technology is with each other. With that in mind Terracotta server is now
        distributed in the Ehcache download. Servers at dev time need to fit into the
        development process. Terracotta has a tc-maven-plugin that works as well and
        simply as the famed Jetty plugin. Instructions on its use are included in the
        download.</p>

    <p>Ehcache Server and Standalone Server have been released to Sourceforge Downloads.
        The server provides RESTful and SOAP APIs to Ehcache. It is available as a WAR
        which works with all app servers, or standalone using Glassfish V3 embedded.</p>

    <p>New in this release is integration with Terracotta Server Array for coherent,
        scalable and HA caching. Also the Ehcache core has been upgraded to version 2.0,
        Jersey to 1.1.5, Metro to 2.1.5 and for standalone, Glassfish to V3
        embedded.</p>

        tested against memcache</a> and gives comparable over-the-network performance.
        Coupled with the simplicity of coding in your HTTP client of choice in your
        programming language of choice and easily getting the benefits of Terracotta
        Server Array backing it, this is a killer combination.</p>

</h4>

    <p>This is a final release of ehcache-1.7.0 comprising ehcache, ehcache-core and
        ehcache-terracotta modules.</p>

    <p>The new 1.7.0 Ehcache module now contains out-of-the-box support for
        Terracotta.</p>

    <p>This release is the first fruits of the merger of Ehcache and Terracotta. It
        enables Ehcache to be Terracotta clustered with only a few lines of config in
        ehcache.xml and no application code changes. See the <a
                href="/documentation/distributed_caching_with_terracotta.html">Terracotta
            Clustering Documentation</a> for configuration and a worked example.</p>

    <p>We anticipate a final release shortly. In the meantime please feel free to check
        it out and kick the tyres.</p>

    <p>See the <a class="externalLink" href="http://ehcache.org/changes-report.html">changelog</a>
        for complete details. Downloads and Maven modules are available <a

    <p>A few more bug fixes have been picked up against the 1.6 core caching engine
        redesign in this release. As with the 1.6 release, if you experience unexpected
        behaviour you can enable the <tt>LinkedHashMap</tt> based engine with <tt>java
            -Dnet.sf.ehcache.use.classic.lru=true</tt>.</p></div>

        name="a18_August_2009:_Ehcache_joins_with_Terracotta"></a></h4>

    <p>The Ehcache project is excited to announce Ehcache's merger with Terracotta.</p>

    <p>Terracotta is committed to maintaining the Ehcache community and plans to retain
        availability of Ehcache as an open source product under the Apache 2 license.
        Ehcache will remain available for download at its current location at
        http://ehcache.org, in the Maven central repository, as well as at it's new home
        at http://ehcache.org.</p>

    <p>As part of the merger, Greg Luck, the maintainer of Ehcache, will join Terracotta
        Inc..</p>

    <p>Both the Ehcache and Terracotta communities will benefit from this merger.</p>

    <p>The Ehcache community will get accelerated development of new Ehcache features
        which will provide a comprehensive, standards-based caching solution for
        existing and upcoming performance challenges.</p>

    <p>Terracotta community members will have a seamless, single-vendor experience with
        easy access to a rich and robust caching solution that scales with their
        businesses.</p>

    <p>Planned integration of the products in the near term will focus on enabling
        Ehcache users to easily add enterprise availability, reliability and data
        integrity capabilities through the Terracotta Server Array.</p>

    <p>This is the first release of JMS replication for ehcache. Thanks to Benoit
        Perroud for getting this going with a code contribution.</p>

    <p>It provides:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>replication between cache nodes using a replication topic, in accordance
            with ehcache's standard replication mechanism
        </li>
        <li>pushing of data directly to cache nodes from external topic publishers, in
            any language. This is done by sending the data to the replication topic,
            where it automatically picked up by the cache subscribers.
        </li>
        <li>a JMSCacheLoader, which sends cache load requests to a queue. Either an
            Ehcache cluster node, or an external queue receiver can respond.
        </li>
    </ul>

        name="a18_August_2008:_Ehcache_1.6_development_underway"></a></h4>

    <p>Ehcache-1.6 development is underway.</p>

    <p>1.6 Goals:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Minimum Java version 1.5</li>
        <li>minimise dependencies for core users: drop commons logging, commons
            collections and backport concurrent (already done in trunk and snapshot)
        </li>
        <li>add a JMS distributed cache replicator</li>
        <li>add RESTful Ehcache server as secondary store, leveraging the new
            ehcache-server, and using partitioning (memcached feature)
        </li>
        <li>introduce new performance strategies and secondary store categories to allow
            greater optimisation. The goal is to make Ehcache faster than
            java.util.concurrent for in-process caching and as scalable as memcached for
            out-of-process caching.
        </li>
        <li>group invalidation (OSCACHE feature)</li>
        <li>add other oustanding feature requests<p>Check trunk regularly for updates.
            For maven users (of which Ehcache is one) a SNAPSOT repository has been
            added. See <a class="externalLink"

    <div class="section"><h4>New Features<a name="New_Features"></a></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Added JGroups Implementation. Thanks to Pierre Monestie for the
                patch(es) for this. Though new to the core distribution JGroups
                replication has been in production use in a large cluster for the last
                year. JGroups has a &quot;provided&quot; scope. So, anyone wishing to
                use this form of replication will need to add it to their dependencies.
            </li>
            <li>CachingFilter performance improvements</li>
            <li>Constructs performance improvements</li>
            <li>added loadAll() to the loader implementation to enable preload without
                specifying keys.
            </li>
            <li>diskPersistent now can be used with caches that use only MemoryStore in
                normal use but want to persist to disk
            </li>
            <li>DiskStores are now optional. The element is now non-mandatory. This will
                simplify configurations particularly where multiple CacheManagers are
                being used. If one or more caches requires a DiskStore, and none is
                configured, java.io.tmpdir will be used and a warning message will be
                logged to encourage explicity configuration of the diskStore path.
            </li>
            <li>The default RMI based cache replication can now configure a RemoteObject
                port so that it can be easily configured to work through firewalls. This
                is done by adding a new property remoteListenerPort to
                RMICacheManagerPeerListenerFactory to enable it to be specified.
            </li>
            <li>Added a new system property expansion token &quot;ehcache.disk.store.dir&quot;
                to DiskStore configuration which can be used to specify the DiskStore
                directory on the command line or in an environment variable.
                <div>
                    <pre>    e.g. java -Dehcache.disk.store.dir=/u01/myapp/diskdir ...</pre>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>Added the ability to specify system property tokens using $<a
                    name="tokenname">tokenname</a> in ehcache.xml which are then
                replaced when the configuration is loaded.
            </li>
            <li>Updated the remote debugger with enhanced reporting and better
                documentation (See Logging page in the documentation).<p>The new version
                    prints a list of caches with replication configured, prints
                    notifications as they happen, and periodically prints the cache
                    name, size and total events received.</p>

                <p>Note that the debugger is gaining more attention and is now
                    distributed in its own tar ball. It has also moved to its own pure
                    maven build and has additional testing.</p></li>

<div class="section"><h4>31 January 2008: ehcache-1.4.0 released<a

    <p>The final version of ehcache-1.4.0 is available on sourceforge and the Maven
        central repository.</p>

    <p>This version significantly enrichens the Ehcache API and enhances extension of
        ehcache. The new features are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can now define CacheLoaders in the Ehcache core API. They supplement the
            existing SelfPopulatingCache. They can be configured in ehcache.xml or
            programmatically. They can be used for cache warming, and simple
            pull-through caching. See the <a href="/documentation/cache_loaders.html">Cache
                Loaders</a> chapter in the documentation for more details.
        </li>
        <li>You can now define a CacheExceptionHandler and register it progammatically
            or in ehcache.xml. This enables an exception handler to be registered with a
            cache so that it is called on exception rather than the exception being
            thrown. See the <a href="/documentation/cache_exception_handlers.html">Cache
                Exception Handler</a> chapter in the documentation for more details.
        </li>
        <li>You can now define CacheExtensions and register them progammatically or in
            ehcache.xml. A CacheExtension is a generic facility which holds a reference
            to a cache and is bound to the cache lifecycle, making possible a wide
            variety of extensions to behaviour. Usage examples are a cache refresh timer
            or a file monitoring mechanism. See the <a
                    href="/documentation/cache_extensions.html">Cache Extensions</a>
            chapter in the documentation for more details.<p>This final release follows

<div class="section"><h4>11 June 2007: ehcache-1.3 released<a
        name="a11_June_2007:_ehcache-1.3_released"></a></h4>

    <p>The next major version of Ehcache has been released.</p>

    <p>This version contains the following major new features over 1.2.4:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A draft JCache API (JSR107) package.</li>
        <li>JMX instrumentation. Register a variety of MBeans from your Ehcache instance
            with your MBeanServer of choice. Care has been taken to make this
            implementation friendly to a wide variety of JMX NMSs.<p>In terms of minor
                features:</p></li>
        <li>A new cache attribute, diskSpoolBufferSizeMB, can be set to control the
            amount of memory that can be used for spooling to DiskStore
        </li>
        <li>The Ehcache shutdown hook is now off by default. Ehcache is typically used
            in scenarios where someone else has a shutdown hook. It can be re-enabled by
            setting <tt>net.sf.ehcache.enableShutdownHook=true</tt>

            <p>The distributed caching feature of Ehcache is now in wide-spread use in
                wide ranging environments. All of this field experience unearthed the
                need for further documentation, clarificationa and bug fixes,
                particularly for dirty or mis-configured networks, which have been
                provided in 1.3. Excellent performance has been reported for clusters
                with up to 20 nodes.</p>

    <p>For anyone attending JavaOne 2007 at the Moscone Centre in San Francisco, the
        maintainer of ehcache, Greg Luck, will be presenting a session entitled &quot;Distributed
        Caching, Using the JCACHE API and ehcache, Including a Case Study&quot;. This

<div class="section"><h4>2 December 2006: ehcache-1.2.4 released<a
        name="a2_December_2006:_ehcache-1.2.4_released"></a></h4>

    <p>This is a candidate for a maintenance release.</p>

    <p>It contains four feature and fifteen bug fixes received in the two months since
        ehcache-1.2.3 was released. See the <a class="externalLink"
                                               href="http://ehcache.org/changes-report.html#1.2.4">changelog</a>
        for details.</p>

    <p>Eight of the changes in this release are scalability improvements contributed by
        users running very large ehcache deployments. The distributed caching changes
        stem from a user who is using Ehcache in a multi-subnet cluster of 20 nodes.</p>

    <p>The Caching and Gzip filters in the web package have been updated to work on
        Glassfish and Tomcat.</p>

    <p>The distributed caching functionality in Ehcache is now 6 months ago.</p>

    <p>The maintainer has now been running Ehcache distributed in production for four
        months without incident.</p>

    <p>Ehcache has no open bugs or patches at the time of release.</p></div>
<div class="section"><h4>2 September 2006: ehcache-1.2.3 released<a
        name="a2_September_2006:_ehcache-1.2.3_released"></a></h4>

    <p>This is a maintenance release. It contains eight feature requests and 6 bug fixes
        received in the two months since ehcache-1.2.2 was released. See the <a
                class="externalLink"
                href="http://ehcache.org/changes-report.html#1.2.3">changelog</a> for
        details.</p>

    <p>All of the feature changes come from the suggestions of people with practical
        experience using ehcache-1.2. The changes are all fine tuning of the distributed
        caching functionality rather than large changes.</p>

    <p>The distributed caching functionality was released four months ago. There are
        many production sites running this now, including that of the maintainers.</p>

    <p>One of the more difficult aspects of getting distributed caching going is getting
        past network configurations that swallow multicast. A tool,
        ehcache-1.2.3-remote-debugger.jar is now included in the distribution so that
        distributed traffic can be listened in on.</p>

    <p>The number of lines of code in Ehcache is now three times bigger than
        ehcache-1.0. They have increased as the features of Ehcache have increased. To
        complement this increase in complexity, commercial support is now available for
        ehcache. Contact kluck@gregluck.com for details.</p>

    <div class="section"><h4>1 September 2006: Ehcache three years old and going
        strong<a name="a1_September_2006:_Ehcache_three_years_old_and_going_strong"></a>
    </h4><img src="images/downloads.gif" alt=""/>

        <p>Ehcache had more than 4000 downloads per month for the last three months in a
            row. This is up from the 1500 downloads per month it was running at for the
            two years before then.</p>

        <p>The result is there is now a much larger user community who use Ehcache
            directly, rather than through one of the popular frameworks. This places new
            demands on the project but also means that most of the code paths and API
            are being utilised, leading to fewer undiscovered bugs and a continuing
            evolution of features.</p></div>

<div class="section"><h4>3 July 2006: ehcache-1.2.1 released<a
        name="a3_July_2006:_ehcache-1.2.1_released"></a></h4>

    <p>ehcache-1.2.1 is mostly a maintenance release of ehcache. It focuses on
        simplifying usage of new features and easing the migration path between
        ehcache-1.1 and ehcache-1.2. While ehcache-1.2 is backward compatible, some
        typical usage scenarios in Hibernate and Spring are not.</p>

    <p>See the separate news item on ehcache-1.2.1RC to get the full picture. Changes
        above ehcache-1.2.1RC are:</p>

    <div class="section"><h4>Improvements<a name="Improvements"></a></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Change Blocking cache to use a lock striping technique for its Mutexes.
                This limits the number of Mutexes to 2048, rather than a number
                equalling the number of keys, while preserving excellent liveness and
                safety. Thanks to Olaf Krische for reporting this and Brian Goetz for
                assisting with a solution.
            </li>
            <li>Change BlockingCache and SelfPopulatingCache to act as decorators for
                Ehcache. Remove now redundant BlockingCacheManager and
                SelfPopulatingCacheManager. Change signatures of these caches from
                Serializable to Object. This change is not backward compatible but no
                libraries use these, so developers can change over on their own
                projects.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section"><h4>Bug fixes<a name="Bug_fixes"></a></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Bug 1190614. This was reported by Victor Volle and is a duplicate of
                1492900. Fixed. * Bug 1506399. Changing all classloading to the context
                classloader is sometimes inconvenient. Fallback to *
                ClassLoaderUtil.class.getClassLoader() if
                Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader() * fails. Thanks to Robert
                Watkins for reporting this one. * Bug 1508623. Debug messages generate
                excess String objects. Added logging level guards around about 6 debug
                log statements. Thanks to Derek Hulley for pointing this one out. *
                Harden all Ehcache threads so that RuntimeExceptions and Errors do not
                stop them. This change, on its own, has been backported to a separate
                release, ehcache-1.2.0_01.

</h4>

    <p>Greg Luck, the maintainer of ehcache, has been added to the JSR-107 expert group.
        The plan is to add a JSR-107 compatibility API to ehcache. The benefit to users
        is that they can switch to and from Ehcache with almost zero code cost, when
        using the JSR-107 API.</p>

    <p>Enabling changes to the Ehcache codebase have been made in the ehcache-1.2.1
        branch (released 3 July). Work on the compatibility API will occur in the 1.3
        branch.</p></div>
<div class="section"><h4>4 June 2006: ehcache-1.2.1RC <a class="externalLink"
                                                         href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=93232">released</a>.<a
        name="a4_June_2006:_ehcache-1.2.1RC_released."></a></h4>

    <p>This is a release candidate for ehcache-1.2.1. There are a few very minor bug
        fixes in this release. The main focus is to resolve upgrade difficulties with
        client libraries which expect Ehcache CacheManagers to be singletons as they
        were in ehcache-1.1. In ehcache-1.2 any attempt to have two CacheManagers
        sharing the same configuration resulted in a CacheException being thrown. The
        check was made on diskStorePath. In ehcache-1.2.1RC multiple CacheManagers
        sharing the same ehcache.xml configuration is permitted.</p>

    <p>To resolve conflicts with DiskStore paths, the second and subsequent
        CacheManagers create their data files in a unique subdirectory under the first
        CacheManager's diskStore path.</p>

    <p>The other potential conflict is in CacheManagerPeerListeners. In the default
        implementation the conflict is with RMI listener ports. To resolve this conflict
        the second and subsequent CacheManagers use a free port to listen on.</p>

    <p>For both, warning messages are logged encouraging clients to migrate over to
        their own ehcache.xml.</p>

    <p>There are also a number of enhancements/new features as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>New SingletonEhCacheProvider for use by Hibernate in situations where code
            has been written which relies on the singleton behaviour of ehcache-1.1 and
            earlier. Most code bases using Hibernate should not require this.
        </li>
        <li>Allow cacheEventListenerFactory elements to be added to defaultCache in
            ehcache.xml. This allows caches created with CacheManager.a ddCache(String
            cacheName) to receive events. This can be used for example to set default
            replication settings in defaultCache.
        </li>
        <li>To complement full support foe default cache (above), added support for
            programmatic addition of caches which include CacheReplicators. Also support
            for removal of these caches with CacheManager.remove(String cacheName).
        </li>
        <li>Andy McNutt's JNDI-based manual RMI replication added. See ehcache.xml
            example for how to use.
        </li>
        <li>Support tomcat 5.5 for the servlet filters. Tomcat integration testing, in
            addition to the Orion one, is also added to the full JUnit test process.
            Tomcat relies on Servlet 2.4 dispatcher INCLUDE and FORWARD directives for
            page fragment caching.
        </li>
        <li>Support runtime setting of individual Element time to lives (TTLs), time to
            idles(TTIs) and eternal overrides. If an override is set, the Element expiry
            ignores the Cache default.
        </li>
        <li>Add a cache bootstrap mechanism. This is used to populate a cache when it is
            first initialized. An abstract factory, BootstrapCacheLoaderFactory has been
            defined along with an interface BootstrapCacheLoader. The initial concrete
            implementations are for RMI, so that a new cache entering a cluster gets
            bootstrapped from a randomly chosen peer.<p>Finally, the ehcache-constructs
                package has been merged into the Ehcache module so that there is only
                one jar to download and install to get all functionaliy.
                Ehcache-constructs contains Java EE Caching filters and other useful
                applied caching solutions.</p>

            <p>See the <a href="/changes-report.html">change log</a> for more details.
            </p>

            <p>The plan is to rapidly release ehcache-1.2.1 within a week or so. Please
                report any issues with ehcache-1.2.1RC promptly. Documentation of the
                new features will be complete during this time.</p></li>

    released.<a name="a25_April_2006:_ehcache-1.2_released."></a></h4>

    <p>After 10 months of development, ehcache-1.2 is released. Thanks to all the
        developers who contributed to the release through feature requests, bug reports
        and patches during the beta program.</p>

    <p>The 1.2 release of Ehcache has many new features including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Flexible, extensible, high performance distributed caching. The default
            implementation supports cache discovery via multicast or manual
            configuration. Updates are delivered either asynchronously or synchronously
            via custom RMI connections. Additional discovery or delivery schemes can be
            plugged in by third parties.
        </li>
        <li>New FIFO and LFU caching policies in addition to the standard LRU.</li>
        <li>Introduced CacheManagerEventListener and CacheEventListener interfaces and
            default implementations.
        </li>
        <li>Multiple CacheManagers per virtual machine.</li>
        <li>Programmatic flushing of application state to persistent caches</li>
        <li>Significant (up to 7 fold) DiskStore performance increases.</li>
        <li>API for Objects in addition to Serializable. Non-serializable Objects can
            use all parts of ehcache except for DiskStore and replication. Two new
            methods on Element: getObjectValue and getKeyValue are the only API
            differences between the Serializable and Object APIs.
        </li>
        <li>Backward Compatibility with ehcache-1.1. All users of ehcache-1.1 should be
            able to upgrade to ehcache-1.2.
        </li>
        <li>Tested with Hibernate2.1.8 and Hibernate3.1.3, which can utilise all of the
            new features except for Object API and multiple session factories each using
            a different Ehcache CacheManager. A new <tt>net.sf.ehcache.hibernate.EhCacheProvider</tt>
            makes those additional features available to Hibernate-3.1.3. A version of
            the new provider should make it into the Hibernate3.2 release.
        </li>
        <li>Tested with ehcache-constructs.</li>
        <li>Apache 2.0 license</li>
    </ul>
    <p>At time of release, there are no open bugs against the ehcache-1.2. 21 bugs have
        been fixed in this release. Most of those were raised against the 1.2 beta
        releases.</p>

<div class="section"><h4>7 February 2006: Whats New in 1.2<a
        name="a7_February_2006:_Whats_New_in_1.2"></a></h4>

    <p>Ehcache-1.2, currently at beta 5, has many new features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Introduced new caching policies in addition to the standard LRU. FIFO and
            LFU were added. LRU remains the default unless explicitly set in each
            cache's configuration. Thanks to Surya Suravarapu for working with me on
            these. The documentation has a new section on caching policies and when to
            use what.
        </li>
        <li>Introduced CacheManagerEventListener and CacheEventListener interfaces and
            default implementations. These can be configured in ehcache.xml or set
            programmatically. Thanks to steve at jofti dot com for help with the
            specification for these.
        </li>
        <li>After requests from Jo Walnes, Paul Hammant and others, I have added normal
            instance constructers to CacheManager which do not act as singletons. The
            factory singleton methods remain for backward compatibility. CacheManager
            can now be constructed with a Configuration object programmatically.
        </li>
        <li>Since version 1.1, Ehcache has had a persistent diskStore, which makes it
            suitable for storing application state. Added a flush method so that, if the
            cache is diskPersistent, it can be programmatically flushed, in addition to
            the automatic flush which happens at shutdown.

        <li>Pluggable Distributed Caching. The default implementation supports cache

        <li>Backward Compatibility</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ehcache-1.2 is mostly backward compatible with ehcache-1.1. Ehcache-1.1
        ehcache.xml configurations are compatible. There have been a few small API
        changes to the ehcache-1.1 API.</p>

        <li>Ehcache has a persistent diskStore, which makes it suitable for storing
            application state. Added a flush method so that, if the cache is
            diskPersistent, it can be programmatically flushed, in addition to the
            automatic flush which happens at shutdown.

        Thanks to Surya Suravarapu for work on these new policies.</p>

    <p>This version of Ehcache should be backwardly compatible with Ehcache 1.1 except
        for a dependency on commons-collections 3.1, up from version 2.1. This version

    <p>A subproject of ehcache, ehcache-constructs builds on top of Ehcache to create

        the backing cache. They also share a common purpose - to create very high
        performance Java applications. New in this version is a fault-tolerant
        AsynchronousCommandExecutor, which will asynchronously execute arbitrary
        commands, optionally retrying on a defined array of Exception types a defined
        number of times at a defined interval.</p></div>

    Ehcache 1.0 released</a>.<a name="a28_September_2004__Ehcache_1.0_released."></a>
</h4>

    <p>This is a major milestone for Ehcache - the 1.0 release. It has several bug fixes
        and a few important new features. They are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Added SelfPopulatingCacheManager to the constructs package.</li>
        <li>Added a new diskExpiryThreadIntervalSeconds configuration option to
            ehcache.xml, to allow tuning of the expiry thread per cache.
        </li>
        <li>Added a new persistent option for the DiskStore. When enabled,
            diskPersistent makes Caches persistent between JVM restarts. It enables very
            long held caches to be configured, useful for very expensive and/or long
            lived cache entries.
        </li>
        <li>Improved code coverage. See clover coverage report.</li>
        <li>New checkstyle rules, using checkstyle 3.4. Many additional checks have been
            added and code cleanups done to make ehcache more standards compliant and
            understandable than ever.
        </li>
    </ul>

    0.9 released</a><a name="a15_July_2004_Ehcache_0.9_released"></a></h4>

    <p>This is a large release. It fixes several bugs and adds many new features
        including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>ehcache.xml cache definitions can now omit timeToIdle and/or timeToLive,
            which have been made optional attributes. This will make cache config easier
            to read for eternal caches. Either omitting the attributes or setting them
            to 0 causes them not to be considered when calculating expiry. Earlier
            versions of ehcache would have immediately expired all elements if either
            attribute was set to 0, so this change should not break any existing code.
        </li>
        <li>Added getQuiet and putQuiet methods to Cache. These methods are the same as
            get and put but do not affect statistics.
        </li>
        <li>Implemented an Element clone method.</li>
        <li>Added calculateInMemorySize() method to Cache to measure the approximate
            size of a cache's memory footprint.
        </li>
        <li>Added a new constructs package.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Blocking, self populating and self populating collections cache implementations
        are provided. They are useful where the cost of creating a cache entry is high,
        and you want to make request threads block until the first one creates the
        entry. While new to ehcache, the package is based on code that has been in
        production for almost a year, and is now ready for a wider audience.</p>
