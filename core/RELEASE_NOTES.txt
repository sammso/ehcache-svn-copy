Release Notes For ehcache version 1.3
=====================================

Introduction
============
ehcache is a pure Java, in-process cache with the following features:

   1. Fast.
   2. Simple.
   3. Multiple eviction policies: LRU, LFU and FIFO.
   4. Caches can be in memory or on disk.
   5. Disk Stores can be persistent between VM restarts.
   6. Distributed caching using multicast and RMI, with a pluggable API.
   7. Cache and CacheManager listeners
   8. Supports multiple Caches per CacheManager, and multiple CacheManagers per application.
   9. Acts as a pluggable cache for Hibernate 3.1, 3 and 2.1.
   10. Small foot print. Both in terms of size and memory requirements.
   11. Minimal dependencies apart from J2SE.
   12. Fully documented. See the online Documentation and the online JavaDoc.
   13. Comprehensive Test Coverage. See the clover test report.
   14. Available under the Apache 1.1 license. EHCache's copyright and licensing has been reviewed and approved by the Apache Software Foundation, making EHCache suitable for use in Apache projects.
   15. Production tested. EHCache is used on a large and very busy eCommerce site.
   16. Web caching, pull-through caches and other common caching implementations are provided in the ehcache-constructs module.

Java Requirements
=================
ehcache supports 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6 at runtime. When compiling from source, the build process requires at least JDK1.5.

ehcache does not work with JDK1.3 or lower.

Dependencies
============
Ehcache requires commons-logging from Apache's Jakarta project.


Installation
============
Place the ehcache-1.2.4.jar into your classpath. Ensure the required dependencies are in the classpath.

Create an ehcache.xml configuration from the one supplied in the distribution and place it in your classpath.

The ehcache-1.2.4-remote-debugger.jar is a tool to be used for distributed debugging. Do not install it in
your project. See http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/documentation/logging.html for how to use it.


Documentation
=============
See http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/documentation for full documentation.

The JavaDoc is in the distribution and also online at http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/javadoc.

Compatibility With Ehcache 1.1
==============================
1. Due to an internal reorganisation in the code base the DiskStore path will default to java.io.tmp when the ehcache-1.1
constructor is used.

2. APIs are the same. CacheException is now a runtime exception. Additionally, IOException is no longer thrown.
This does not cause a runtime error but will cause a compile time error if clients are recompiled against ehcache. In
this case change the code to not catch an IOException. Catching CacheException is optional.

Known Issues
============

1. Due to a limitation in RMI, JDK1.5 or higher is required to run multiple distributed CacheManagers on the same machine.
   Normally distributed caching is used between clusters of machines, so this should not be an issue to many people.

2. RMI listeners are unable to start on all versions of Tomcat, where Tomcat has spaces in its
   installation path. The default install location on Windows has spaces in the path, so it should be changed.
