Introduction
============
ehcache is a pure Java, in-process cache with the following features:

   1. Fast
   2. Simple
   3. Act as a pluggable cache for Hibernate 2.1.
   4. Small foot print. Both in terms of size and memory requirements.
   5. Minimal dependencies apart from J2SE.
   6. Fully documented. See the online Documentation and the online JavaDoc.
   7. Comprehensive Test Coverage. See the clover test report.
   8. Available under the Apache 1.1 license. EHCache's copyright and licensing has been reviewed and approved by the Apache Software Foundation, making EHCache suitable for use in Apache projects.
   9. Production tested. All versions of EHCache are production tested for several weeks on a large and very busy eCommerce site before release.

Java Requirements
=================
ehcache supports JDK1.2, 1.3, 1.4 and 1.5 at runtime. When compiling from source, the build process requires JDK 1.4 or JDK1.5.

ehcache does not work with JDK1.1.

Dependencies
============
For JDK1.4, ehcache requires commons-logging from Apache's Jakarta project.

For JDK1.2 and JDK 1.3, ehcache requires:

- Apache Jakarta's commons-collections, version 2.1
- Apache xerces (xml-apis.jar and xercesImpl.jar), version 2.5

All three dependencies are also Hibernate dependencies, so if you are using ehcache as a Hibernate plugin, dependency requirements are met.


Installation
============
Place ehcache-x.x.jar into your classpath. Ensure the required dependencies are in the
classpath.

Documentation
=============
See http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/documentation for
full documentation.

The JavaDoc is in the distribution and also online at
http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/javadoc.

Configuration
=============
The distribution contains an example configuration file
called ehcache.xml and its accompanying schema, ehcache.xsd.

To configure ehcache, edit ehcache.xml.

For Hibernate it must be placed in your classpath. For use
as a general case you can specify its location as a parameter
of CacheManager.create(...).

See http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/documentation/#configuration for
more information.
