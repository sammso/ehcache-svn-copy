    This package contains the functionality to provide XA support to a transactional Cache.
  <p>
      Currently the only support for transactional Cache is XA. As such, this package contains the implementation of the
      {@link net.sf.ehcache.transaction.TransactionContext TransactionContext} for XA support
      ({@link net.sf.ehcache.transaction.xa.XATransactionContext XATransactionContext}).
  </p>
  <p>
      As of now, only READ_COMMITED isolation level is provided. This is being handled by both
      {@link net.sf.ehcache.transaction.xa.XATransactionContext XATransactionContext} (being the local transactional data) and
      {@link net.sf.ehcache.store.XATransactionalStore XATransactionalStore} (wrapping the underlying
      {@link net.sf.ehcache.store.Store Store} instance and keeping the "in-transaction operations" on the cache in sync with
      the {@link net.sf.ehcache.transaction.TransactionContext TransactionContext} XA implementation.
  </p>
  <p>
      It also contains the JTA XAResource implementation for Ehcache: {@link net.sf.ehcache.transaction.xa.EhcacheXAResourceImpl}.
