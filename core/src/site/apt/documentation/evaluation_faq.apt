Evaluation FAQ

 See the {{{faq.html}FAQ}} for general FAQ questions. These ones are Q and A geared towards those evaluating
 Ehcache.


* There are a lot of product choices? Which one should I use?

   Terracotta Ehcache is available in DX, EX and FX versions.

   There is an Ehcache {{{/EhcacheBrochure.pdf}product brochure}} which explains the choices. That is a good
   start.

   Simply put Ehcache DX is standalone and non-Terracotta clustering, EX and FX are Terracotta clustered. FX adds
   striping for massive scale.

   DX and EX are supported and indemnified versions. These editions are also available as open source, simply by downloading
      from the ehcache.org and terracotta.org respectively.

   FX is commercial only.

* What are the software licenses used.

    Terracotta Open Source is available with TPL.

    The Ehcache open source modules are released under an Apache license.

    There are some modules which are part of the commercial product offering e.g. monitoring server.
    These are available under a Terracotta Commercial License.
