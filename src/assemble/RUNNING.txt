Running the Server
==================

There are three ways to start the server. All are done from the bin directory.

Using Commons Daemon jsvc
-------------------------

jsvc creates a daemon which returns once the service is started. jsvc works on all common Unix-based operating systems
including Linux, Solaris and Mac OS X.

It creates a pid file in the pid directory.

This is a Unix shell script that starts the server as a daemon.

To use jsvc you must install the native binary jsvc from the Apache Commons Daemon project.
The source for this is distributed in the bin directory as jsvc.tar.gz.
Untar it and follow the instructions for building it or download a binary from the Commons Daemon project.

Convenience shell scripts are provided as follows:

start - daemon_start.sh
stop  - daemon_stop.sh

jsvc is designed to integrate with Unix System 5 initialization scripts. (/etc/rc.d)

You can also send Unix signals to it. Meaningful ones for the Ehcache Standalone Server are:

No      Meaning     Ehcache Standalone Server Effect

1       HUP         Restarts the server.
2       INT         Interrupts the server.
9       KILL        The process is killed. The server is not given a chance to shutdown.
15      TERM        Stops the server, giving it a chance to shutdown in an orderly way.

Executable jar
--------------

The server is also packaged as an executable jar for developer convenience which will work on all operating systems.

A convenience shell script is provided as follows:

start - startup.sh

From the bin directory you can also invoke the following command directly:

unix    - java -jar ../lib/${project.build.finalName}.jar <http port> ../war
windows - java -jar ..\lib\${project.build.finalName}.jar <http port> ..\war


Ports
-----

The HTTP listening port is specified on the command line. The Ehcache Server also opens a JMX listening port so that it
can be monitored. This is always the HTTP listening port + 1. So, if port 8080 is specified for HTTP, port 8081 will be
used for JMX.
