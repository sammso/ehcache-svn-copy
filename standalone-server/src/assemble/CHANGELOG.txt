1.0 31 March 2010
=================

1. Upgraded to GFV3.

2. Upgraded to 0.9 ehcache-server module.

3. Added SLF4J which is now used in Ehcache.

4. Changed start script to specify mx of 1GB. Increase this to whatever cache you want.


0.7 11 April 2009
=================

1. Upgraded to GFV3 Embedded b14. This fixes a number of issues that were reported to the GFV3 team by this project:

    - the JMX server now starts, so Ehcache Standalone Server may be monitored
    - directory listings are now disabled, avoiding confusion.
    - the default port of 8888 was always started and then swapped out to the port specified in the command line. That
      is now fixed, so that only the specified port starts. This issue was preventing installation of more than
      one instance on a machine and on machines with that port already in use.

2. Upgraded ehcache-server to 0.7. This brings in an improvement to PUT so that a per element time to live may
       be specified using the HTTP request header "ehcacheTimeToLiveSeconds".

3. As of this release two ports are used: the HTTP port which is specfied in the command line, and the JMX port, which is
   set to the HTTP listening port + 1. 

0.6 24 December 2008
====================

1. Upgrade to Glassfish V3 Prelude Embedded.
2. Added RMI JMXConnectorServer, exposing the platform MBeanServer which the server module is using to register ehcache mbeans.
3. Bundles the upgrade to 0.6 of Ehcache Server, with several improvements as follows:

   -    Register Ehcache core MBeans with the platform MBeanServer. This adds Ehcache JMX support
        to the web container, which can then be accessed by JMX consoles in the same way that the
        web container supports, which is normally exposing an RMI service URL. See the documentation
        for examples on how to use this with Tomcat and Glassfish.

   -    Upgrade Jersey to the 1.0 release. There are no behavioural changes.

   -    Cache resources now return a more complete representation showing configuration and statistics sub-elements.

   -    Added a DELETE cachename/* method to the API. Use this to clear the contents of a cache without removing
         the cache itself.

   -    Upgraded to ehcache-1.6-beta2.

0.5 15 October 2008
===================

1. Set the "application/octet-stream" mime type to uploads which do not set a MIME Type, rather than erroring out.
2. Add additional information to the cache element.


0.4 20 August 2008
==================

1. Fix bug where specifying the port in the command line is being ignored.

0.3 3 August 2008
=================

1. Fix bug in jsvc where it will not start on Java's that do not suppor -server
2. Upgrade cache server to 0.3. This version skips 0.2 so as to get in sync with the cache server releases.


0.1 18 July 2008
================

Initial version
