Getting Started

    Ehcache can be used directly. It can also be used with the popular Hibernate Object/Relational tool. Finally, it
    can be used for Java EE Servlet Caching.

    This quick guide gets you started on each of these. The rest of the documentation can be explored for a deeper
     understanding.


* {General Purpose Caching}

      * Make sure you are using a supported {{{./dependencies.html#java}Java}} version.

      * Place the ehcache jar into your classpath.

      * Ensure that any libraries required to satisfy {{{./dependencies.html}dependencies}} are also in the classpath.

      * Configure ehcache.xml and place it in your classpath.

      * Optionally, configure an appropriate {{{./logging.html}logging}} level.

      See {{{../samples.html}Code Samples}} for more information on direct interaction with ehcache.

* Hibernate

    * Perform the same steps as {{{#General Purpose Caching}General Purpose Caching}}.

    * Create caches in ehcache.xml.

    See {{{./hibernate.html}Hibernate Caching}} for more information.

* Java EE Servlet Caching

    * Perform the same steps as {{{General Purpose Caching}General Purpose Caching}}.

    * Configure a cache for your web page in ehcache.xml.

    * To cache an entire web page, either use SimplePageCachingFilter or create your own subclass of CachingFilter

    * To cache a jsp:Include or anything callable from a RequestDispatcher, either use SimplePageFragmentCachingFilter
    or create a subclass of PageFragmentCachingFilter.

    * Configure the web.xml. Declare the filters created above and create filter mapping associating the filter with
    a URL.

    See {{{./j2ee_servlet_caching.html}Java EE Servlet Caching}} for more information.


* Spring, Cocoon, Acegi and other frameworks

   Usually, with these, you are using ehcache without even realising it. The first steps in getting more control
   over what is happening are:

   * discover the cache names used by the framework

   * create your own ehcache.xml with settings for the caches and place it in the application classpath.
