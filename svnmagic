To merge from trunk to branch.

1. Find the branch point on the branch.

svn log --verbose --stop-on-copy

This will stop at the branch point

2. Find out where trunk is at

svn update

3. Do the merge from trunk

svn merge -r 246:248 . ../branches/ehcache-1.2.4

4. Commit with a commit message that indicated the merge so you know it for next time

e.g. svn commit -m "Merge from trunk svn merge -r 246:248 . ../branches/ehcache-1.2.4"
