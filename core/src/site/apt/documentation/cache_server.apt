{Cache Server}

    Introduced in ehcache-1.6, ehcache comes with a Cache Server. The server CacheExtensions are a general purpose mechanism to allow {generic extensions to a Cache}.



*   Architecture

    Ehcache server uses JAX-WS for SOAP and Jersey for RESTful Web Services. Ehcache supports both to give users the
    maximum of choice. The beauty of both is that no Ehcache client is required. A client can be created trivially in
    whatever programming language. With support for REST, that even extends to languages that do not hava SOAP implementations.

    By default, Glassfish V3 Core embedded is used as the HTTP server on which to run these. Glassfish uses NIO
    for high performance. However Ehcache Server is also downloadable as a WAR which can be embedded in any
    Servlet 2.5 Web Container, such as Weblogic, Websphere, Tomcat or Jetty. 

    Ehcache Server requires Java 5 or higher.

*   A Note on Terminology

    Leonard Richardson and Sam Ruby have done a great job of clarifying the different Web Services architectures and
    distinguishing them from each other. See {http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596529260/}.

    Their taxonomy is used in the following discussion.


*   W3C Web Services

    The W3C ({http://www.w3.org/} is a standards body that defines Web Services as

---
    The World Wide Web is more and more used for application to application communication.
    The programmatic interfaces made available are referred to as Web services.
---

    They provide a set of recommendations for achieving this. See {http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/}.

    An interoperability organisation, WS-I {http://www.ws-i.org/}, seeks to achieve interoperabilty between
    W3C Web Services. The W3C specifications for SOAP and WSDL are required to meet the WS-I definition.

    Ehcache is using Glassfish's libraries to provide it's W3C web services. The project known as Metro
    follows the WS-I definition.

    Finally, OASIS ({http://oasis-open.org}), defines a Web Services Security specification for SOAP: WS-Security.
    The current version is 1.1. It provides three main security mechanisms: ability to send security tokens as part of a 
    message, message integrity, and message confidentiality.

    Ehcache's W3C Web Services support the stricter WS-I definition and use the SOAP and WSDL specfications.

    Specifically:

    * The method of operation is in the entity-body of the SOAP envelope and a HTTP header. POST is always
      used as the HTTP method.

    * The scoping information, used to identify the resource to perform the method on, is contained in the
      SOAP entity-body. The URI path is always the same for a given Web Service - it is the service "endpoint".

    * The Web Service is described by and exposes a {WSDL} (Web Services Description Language) file. It contains the methods, their arguments and what data
      types are used.

    * The {WS-Security} SOAP extensions are supported


** W3C Web Services API

    The Ehcache RESTFul Web Services API exposes the singleton CacheManager, which typically has been configured
    in ehcache.xml or an IoC container. Multiple CacheManagers are not supported.

    The API definition is as follows:

    * WSDL - {{{http://ehcache.sf.net/wsdl/EhcacheWebServiceEndpointService.wsdl}EhcacheWebServiceEndpointService.wsdl}}

    * Types - {{{http://ehcache.sf.net/wsdl/EhcacheWebServiceEndpointService_schema1.xsd}EhcacheWebServiceEndpointService_schema1.xsd}}


**  Security

    By default no security is configured. Because it is simply a Servlet 2.5 web application, it can be secured in all the
    usual ways by configuration in the web.xml.

    XWSS 3.0 is used to secure the Web Service. See {{https://xwss.dev.java.net/}}.

    



*   RESTful Web Services

    Roy Fielding created the term REST, denoting Representational State Transfer, in his
    {{{http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm}PhD thesis}}.

    The ehcache implementation strictly follows the RESTful resource-oriented architecture style.

    Specifically:

    * The HTTP methods GET, HEAD, PUT/POST and DELETE are used to specify the method of the operation. The
      URI does not contain method information.

    * The scoping information, used to identify the resource to perform the method on, is contained in the
      URI path.

    * The RESTful Web Service is described by and exposes a {WADL} (Web Application Description Language) file.
      It contains the URIs you can call, and what data to pass and get back.


** RESTFul Web Services API

    The Ehcache RESTFul Web Services API exposes the singleton CacheManager, which typically has been configured
    in ehcache.xml or an IoC container. Multiple CacheManagers are not supported.

    The resources are encoded as /{cache}/{element}

** CacheManager Resource Operations

*** OPTIONS /

    Lists the methods supported by the CacheManager resource


*** {GET} /

    Lists the Caches in the CacheManager.

** Cache Resource Operations

*** OPTIONS /\{cache\}/

    Lists the methods supported by the Cache resource


*** GET /\{cache\}

    Lists the elements in the cache.

*** {PUT} /\{cache\}

    Creates a Cache using the defaultCache configuration.

*** {DELETE} / \{cache\}

    Deletes the Cache.

** WADL

   The WADL is automatically generated and is accessible at /ehcache/application.wadl

** Element Resource Operations

*** OPTIONS /\{cache\}/\{element\}

    Lists the methods supported by the Element resource

*** HEAD /\{cache\}/\{element\}

    Retrieves the same metadata a GET would receive returned as HTTP headers. There is no body returned.

*** GET /\{cache\}/\{element\}

    Gets the element.

*** HEAD /\{cache\}/\{element\}

    Gets the element's metadata.

*** {PUT} /\{cache\}/\{element\}

    Puts and element into the Cache.

*** {DELETE} / \{cache\}/\{element\}

    Deletes the element from the cache.

**  Resource Representations

    We deal with resource representations rather than resources themselves.


*** Element Resource Representations

    When Elements are PUT into the cache, a MIME Type should be set in the request header.
    The MIME Type is preserved and put into the response header when a GET is done.

    Some common MIME Types which are expected to be used by clients are:

*-----*------*
 text/plain | Plain text
*-----*------*
 text/xml | Extensible Markup Language. Defined in RFC 3023
*-----*------*
 application/json | JavaScript Object Notation JSON. Defined in RFC 4627
*-----*------*
 application/x-java-serialized-object | A serialized Java object
*-----*------*

    Because ehcache is a distributed Java cache, in some configurations the Cache server may contain Java objects
    that arrived at the Cache server via distributed replication. In this case no MIME Type will be set
    and the Element will be examined to determine its MIME Type.

    Because anything that can be PUT into the cache server must be Serializable, it can also be distributed
    in a cache cluster i.e. it will be Serializable.

**  Security

    By default no security is configured. Because it is simply a Servlet 2.5 web application, it can be secured in all the
    usual ways by configuration in the web.xml.

*   Requirements

**  Java

    Java 5 or 6

**  Web Container (WAR packaged version only)

    The standalone server comes with its own embedded Glassfish web container.

    The web container must support the Servlet 2.5 specification.

    The following web container configuration have been tested:

    * Glassfish V2/V3

    * Tomcat 6

    * Jetty 6

*   Downloading

    The server is available as follows:

**  Sourceforge

    Download {{{http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=93232}here}}.

    There are two tarball archives in tar.gz format:

    * ehcache-server - this contains the WAR file which must be deployed in your own web container.

    * ehcache-standalone-server - this contains a complete standalone directory structure with an embedded Glassfish V3 web container
      together with shell scripts for starting and stopping.

**  Maven

    The Ehcache Server is in the central Maven repository packaged as type <jar>. Use the following Maven pom snippet:

---
   <dependency>
        <groupId>net.sf.ehcache</groupId>
        <artifactId>ehcache-server</artifactId>
        <version>0.1</version>
        <type>war</type>
   </dependency>
---

*   Installation

**  Installing the WAR

    Use your Web Container's instructions to install the WAR or include the WAR in your project with
    Maven's war plugin.

    Web Container specific configuration is provided in the WAR as follows:

    * sun-web.xml - Glassfish V2/V3 configuration

    * jetty-web.xml - Jetty V5/V6 configuration

    Tomcat V6 passes all integration tests. It does not require a specific configuration.

**   Configuring the Web Application

    Expand the WAR.

    Edit the web.xml.

***  Disabling the RESTful Web Service

    Comment out the RESTful web service section.

***  Disabling the SOAP Web Service

    Comment out the RESTful web service section.

***  Configuring Caches

    The ehcache.xml configuration file is located in WEB-INF/classes/ehcache.xml.

    Follow the instructions in this config file, or the core ehcache instructions to configure.

***  SOAP Web Service Security

*   Installing the Standalone Server

    The WAR also comes packaged with a standalone server, based on Glassfish V3 Embedded.

    The quick start is:

    * Untar the download

    * bin/start.sh to start. By default it will listen on port 8080, will have both RESTful and SOAP
      web services enabled, and will use a sample Ehcache configuration from the WAR module.

    * bin/stop.sh to stop

    See the INSTALL.txt that comes with the tarball for detailed instructions.

**  Configuring the Standalone Server

    Configuration is by editing the war/web.xml file as per the instructions for the WAR packaging.

**  Starting and Stopping

    * bin/start.sh to start. By default it will listen on port 8080, will have both RESTful and SOAP
      web services enabled, and will use a sample Ehcache configuration from the WAR module.

    * bin/stop.sh to stop

**  Running the Standalone Server as a Unix Service

    The standalone server can be run as a daemon using the jsvc tool from the Apache commons-daemon project.
    Source tarballs for jsvc are included in the jscv directory of the tarball.

    See {{http://commons.apache.org/daemon/jsvc.html}} for full details.

    with the Apache binaries, and need to be compiled.

    Building jsvc requires a C ANSI compiler (such as GCC), GNU Autoconf, and a JDK.

Before running the script, the JAVA_HOME environment variable should be set to the base path of the JDK. Alternately, when calling the ./configure script, the path of the JDK may be specified using the --with-java parameter, such as ./configure --with-java=/usr/java.

Using the following commands should result in a compiled jsvc binary, located in the $CATALINA_HOME/bin folder. This assumes that GNU TAR is used, and that CATALINA_HOME is an environment variable pointing to the base path of the Tomcat installation.

Please note that you should use the GNU make (gmake) instead of the native BSD make on FreeBSD systems.

Download a commons-daemon binary from the Jakarta Commons download page, and place jsvc.tar.gz and commons-daemon.jar in the $CATALINA_HOME/bin folder.



    cd $CATALINA_HOME/bin
    tar xvfz jsvc.tar.gz
    cd jsvc-src
    autoconf
    ./configure
    make
    cp jsvc ..
    cd ..


Tomcat can then be run as a daemon using the following commands.



    cd $CATALINA_HOME
    ./bin/jsvc -cp ./bin/bootstrap.jar \
        -outfile ./logs/catalina.out -errfile ./logs/catalina.err \
        org.apache.catalina.startup.Bootstrap


jsvc has other useful parameters, such as -user which causes it to switch to another user after the daemon initialization is complete. This allows, for example, running Tomcat as a non privileged user while still being able to use privileged ports. jsvc --help will return the full jsvc usage information. In particular, the -debug option is useful to debug issues running jsvc.

The file $CATALINA_HOME/bin/jsvc/native/tomcat.sh can be used as a template for starting Tomcat automatically at boot time from /etc/init.d. The file is currently setup for running Tomcat 4.1.x, so it is necessary to edit it and change the classname from BootstrapService to Bootstrap.

Note that the Commons-Daemon JAR file must be on your runtime classpath to run Tomcat in this manner. The Commons-Daemon JAR file is in the Class-Path entry of the bootstrap.jar manifest, but if you get a ClassNotFoundException or a NoClassDefFoundError for a Commons-Daemon class, add the Commons-Daemon JAR to the -cp argument when launching jsvc.
