* Latest News

** 30 November 2009: New 1.7.1 GA release - ehcache, ehcache-core and ehcache-terracotta

  This is a final GA release of ehcache-1.7.1 comprising ehcache, ehcache-core and ehcache-terracotta modules.

  This release contains 15 fixes and improvements over 1.7.0. See the {{{http://ehcache.org/changes-report.html}changelog}} for complete details.
  Downloads and Maven modules are available {{{http://www.terracotta.org/dl/ehcache-oss-sign-up}here}}.

  Very significantly, this release will enable new GA releases of the other ehcache modules, such as ehcache-web, which we expect to release
  over the next few weeks.

  Note: If you experience different caching ergonomics you can enable the <<<LinkedHashMap>>> based engine with
  <<<java -Dnet.sf.ehcache.use.classic.lru=true>>>. This is the engine enabled up to 1.5.


** 21 November 2009: Greg Luck, founder of ehcache, is in the US for two months/Roadmap Updated

  Greg Luck, the founder of ehcache and now part of Terracotta, is working out of the Terracotta office in San Francisco.

  Please contact Greg at gluck A T terracottatech.com if you would like to schedule him for JUGs or visits.

  There is plenty happening with Ehcache since the injection of Terracotta resources. See the newly updated {{{/roadmap.html}roadmap}}
  for details.

** 10 November 2009: New monitoring beta release

  This is a beta release of the new Ehcache Monitoring and Management server, featuring enterprise-class monitoring and management for development and production.
  Get the {{{http://www.terracotta.org/ehcache/ehcache-dx}Ehcache Monitor Beta}} now.


** 13 October 2009: New 1.7.0 releases - ehcache, ehcache-core and the new ehcache-terracotta

  This is a final release of ehcache-1.7.0 comprising ehcache, ehcache-core and ehcache-terracotta modules.

  The new 1.7.0 Ehcache module now contains out-of-the-box support for Terracotta.

  This release is the first fruits of the merger of Ehcache and Terracotta. It enables Ehcache to be Terracotta clustered
  with only a few lines of config in ehcache.xml and no application code changes. See the {{{/documentation/distributed_caching_with_terracotta.html}Terracotta Clustering Documentation}}
  for configuration and a worked example.

  We anticipate a final release shortly. In the meantime please feel free to check it out and kick the tyres.

  See the {{{http://ehcache.org/changes-report.html}changelog}} for complete details. Downloads and Maven modules
  are available {{{http://www.terracotta.org/dl/ehcache-oss-sign-up}here}}.

  A few more bug fixes have been picked up against the 1.6 core caching engine redesign in this release. As with the 1.6 release,
  if you experience unexpected behaviour you can enable the <<<LinkedHashMap>>> based engine with
  <<<java -Dnet.sf.ehcache.use.classic.lru=true>>>.

** 5 October 2009: New beta 1.7.0-beta releases - ehcache, ehcache-core and the new ehcache-terracotta

  This is a beta release of ehcache-1.7.0 comprising ehcache, ehcache-core and ehcache-terracotta modules.


** 29 September 2009: Subversion, JIRA, Forums and Mailing List migrated to Terracotta Infrastructure

  As announced at the time of acquisition, Subversion, JIRA, Forums and Mailing List have now been migrated to
  Terracotta Infrastructure. Please check the site links for the latest correct URLs.

  File and Maven released will be made to SourceForge and Sonatype/Central for a fortcoming 1.7 release.


** 23 August 2009: Ehcache Core 1.6.2 released

  This is a production maintenance release of ehcache-1.6. Users of 1.6 should upgrade to 1.6.2.

  Download {{{http://www.terracotta.org/dl/ehcache-oss-sign-up}here}}. All documentation is {{{http://ehcache.org/documentation}here}}.
  The release is also available on Maven central. Note that Maven will report a checksum error.
  It is caused by a bug in Maven 2.1.0 and can be ignored.

  There are no open core bugs at the time of release.

  For those still wishing to use the old engine it can be turned on at runtime
  using <<<java -Dnet.sf.ehcache.use.classic.lru=true>>>.



** 18 August 2009: Ehcache joins with Terracotta

  The Ehcache project is excited to announce Ehcache's merger with Terracotta.

  Terracotta is committed to maintaining the Ehcache community and plans to retain availability of Ehcache as an
  open source product under the Apache 2 license. Ehcache will remain available for download at its current location
  at http://ehcache.org, in the Maven central repository, as well as at it's new home at http://ehcache.org.

  As part of the merger, Greg Luck, the maintainer of Ehcache, will join Terracotta Inc..

  Both the Ehcache and Terracotta communities will benefit from this merger.

  The Ehcache community will get accelerated development of new Ehcache features which will provide a comprehensive,
  standards-based caching solution for existing and upcoming performance challenges.

  Terracotta community members will have a seamless, single-vendor experience with easy access to a rich and robust
  caching solution that scales with their businesses.

  Planned integration of the products in the near term will focus on enabling Ehcache users to easily add enterprise availability,
  reliability and data integrity capabilities through the Terracotta Server Array.

  See Terracotta's {{{http://www.terracotta.org/web/display/orgsite/Terracotta+Acquires+Ehcache}news announcement}} for more detail.

  Greg Luck also has a {{{http://gregluck.com/blog/archives/2009/08/ehcache_joins_w.html}blog post}} on the merger.
