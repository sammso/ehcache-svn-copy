** 8 April 2006: Elements are no longer required to be Serializable

     Following many requests, ehcache no longer requires that Elements contain Serializable keys and values. Ehcache
     will gracefully degrade for those operations which require Serialization.

     In particular the MemoryStore and event listeners can be used with Non Serializable elements.

     WARNING error messages are logged when an operation cannot be completed because the key or value is not Serializable.


** 28 March 2006: License changed from Apache 1.1 to Apache 2.0

     The ehcache 1.2 series from beta5 is released under the Apache 2.0 license.


** 26 March 2006: {{{http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=93232}1.2 beta 5 released}}.

     This is a bug fix release which fixes all reported issues in the new 1.2 features. Developers should be
     testing this version.

     The 1.2 beta series of ehcache has many new features including:

            * Distributed Caching. The default implementation
          supports cache discovery via multicast or manual configuration. Updates
          are delivered asynchronously or synchronously via custom RMI
          connections. Additional discovery or delivery schemes can be plugged in
          by third parties.

            * New FIFO and LFU caching policies in addition to the standard LRU.

            * Introduced CacheManagerEventListener and CacheEventListener
          interfaces and default implementations.

            * Multiple CacheManagers per virtual machine.

            * Programmatic flushing of application state to persistent caches


            * Significant (up to 7 fold) DiskStore performance increases.


            * Backward Compatibility with ehcache-1.1

          See the {{{/changes-report.html}changelog}} for more details on the release.


** 25 March 2006: Subversion

    Ehcache is now on Subversion. See the {{{/source-repository.html}source repository page}} for details.
