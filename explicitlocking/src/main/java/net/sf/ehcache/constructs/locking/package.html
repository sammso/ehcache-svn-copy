This package contains an implementation of an Ehcache which provides for explicit locking,
using READ and WRITE locks.

It is possible to get more control over Ehcache's locking behaviour.

<h3>Standalone Ehcache</h3>

In standalone ehcache core, there is no locking. The last write wins. This is akin to
the READ_UNCOMMITTED isolation level.

<h3>Ehcache clustered with Terracotta</h3>

In this case the cache is always coherent, aking to READ_COMMITTED isolation level. This
package simply gives you more control over when locks are acquired and released.

Steve - please expand. 

<h2>How it works</h2>

A READ lock does not prevent other READers from also acquiring a READ lock and reading. A
READ lock cannot be obtained if there is an oustanding WRITE lock - it will queue.

A WRITE lock cannot be obtained while there are outstanding READ locks - it will queue.

In each case to avoid locking problems, the lock should be released after use. The lock
release should be in a <pre>finally</pre> block.

If before each read, you acquire a READ lock and then before each write you acquire a WRITE
lock, then an isolation level akin to READ_COMMITTED is achieved.
