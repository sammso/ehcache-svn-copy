The JMS package works as follows:

    


    A CacheManagerPeerProviderFactory

  A JMSCacheManagerPeerListener subscribes to topic names on a given JMS connection for each cache
    listed in the factory cacheNames property. Topics should be set up on the messageQueue exactly matching
    the cacheNames.

  A JMSSynchronousCacheReplicator sends an XML form of EventMessage to the topic on the given JMS Connection.

  todo should Asynchronous also be supported?



  Due to the variety of ways a ready to go JMS ConnectionFactory can be created, according to JMS vendor. This leaves
    it completely flexible how the ConnectionFactory is created.

  todo should JMS be in a separate maven module?
  todo should some factoryfactories be created, such as for JBoss, Open MQ and Active MQ?


    A CacheManagerPeerListener is not used with JMS. Because a message queue is a fixed piece of infrastructure
    with a known location, there is no need for discovery.
