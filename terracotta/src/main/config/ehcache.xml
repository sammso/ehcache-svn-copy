CacheManager Configuration
==========================
An ehcache.xml corresponds to a single CacheManager.

See instructions below or the ehcache schema (ehcache.xsd) on how to configure.

System property tokens can be specified in this file which are replaced when the configuration
is loaded. For example multicastGroupPort=${multicastGroupPort} can be replaced with the
System property either from an environment variable or a system property specified with a
command line switch such as -DmulticastGroupPort=4446.

The attributes of <ehcache> are:
* name - an optional name for the CacheManager.  The name is optional and primarily used 
for documentation or to distinguish Terracotta clustered cache state.  With Terracotta 
clustered caches, a combination of CacheManager name and cache name uniquely identify a 
particular cache store in the Terracotta clustered memory.
* updateCheck - an optional boolean flag specifying whether this CacheManager should check
for new versions of Ehcache over the Internet.  If not specified, updateCheck="true".
* monitoring - an optional setting that determines whether the CacheManager should 
automatically register the SampledCacheMBean with the system MBean server.  Currently,
this monitoring is only useful when using Terracotta and thus the "autodetect" value 
will detect the presence of Terracotta and register the MBean.  Other allowed values 
are "on" and "off".  The default is "autodetect".

         xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="ehcache.xsd"
             updateCheck="true" monitoring="autodetect">
    
    <!-- 
    DiskStore configuration
    =======================

    The diskStore element is optional. To turn off disk store path creation, comment out the diskStore
    element below.

    Configure it if you have overflowToDisk or diskPersistent enabled for any cache.

    If it is not configured, and a cache is created which requires a disk store, a warning will be
     issued and java.io.tmpdir will automatically be used.

    diskStore has only one attribute - "path". It is the path to the directory where
    .data and .index files will be created.

    If the path is one of the following Java System Property it is replaced by its value in the
    running VM. For backward compatibility these are not specified without being enclosed in the ${token}
    replacement syntax.

    The following properties are translated:
    * user.home - User's home directory
    * user.dir - User's current working directory
    * java.io.tmpdir - Default temp file path
    * ehcache.disk.store.dir - A system property you would normally specify on the command line
      e.g. java -Dehcache.disk.store.dir=/u01/myapp/diskdir ...

    Subdirectories can be specified below the property e.g. java.io.tmpdir/one

    -->
    <diskStore path="java.io.tmpdir"/>


    <!--
    CacheManagerEventListener
    =========================
    Specifies a CacheManagerEventListenerFactory which is notified when Caches are added
    or removed from the CacheManager.

    The attributes of CacheManagerEventListenerFactory are:
    * class - a fully qualified factory class name
    * properties - comma separated properties having meaning only to the factory.

    Sets the fully qualified class name to be registered as the CacheManager event listener.

    The events include:
    * adding a Cache
    * removing a Cache

    Callbacks to listener methods are synchronous and unsynchronized. It is the responsibility
    of the implementer to safely handle the potential performance and thread safety issues
    depending on what their listener is doing.

    If no class is specified, no listener is created. There is no default.
    -->
    <cacheManagerEventListenerFactory class="" properties=""/>

    <!--
    TerracottaConfig
    ========================
    (Enable for Terracotta clustered operation)

    Note: You need to install and run one or more Terracotta servers to use Terracotta clustering.
    See http://www.terracotta.org/web/display/orgsite/Download.

    Specifies a TerracottaConfig which will be used to configure the Terracotta
    runtime for this CacheManager.
    
    Configuration can be specified in two main ways: by reference to a source of 
    configuration or by use of an embedded Terracotta configuration file.
    
    To specify a reference to a source (or sources) of configuration, use the url 
    attribute.  The url attribute must contain a comma-separated list of:
    * path to Terracotta configuration file (usually named tc-config.xml)
    * URL to Terracotta configuration file
    * <server host>:<port> of running Terracotta Server instance
    
    Simplest example for pointing to a Terracotta server on this machine:
    <terracottaConfig url="localhost:9510"/>
    
    Example using a path to Terracotta configuration file:
    <terracottaConfig url="/app/config/tc-config.xml"/>
    
    Example using a URL to a Terracotta configuration file:
    <terracottaConfig url="http://internal/ehcache/app/tc-config.xml"/>
    
    Example using multiple Terracotta server instance URLs (for fault tolerance):
    <terracottaConfig url="host1:9510,host2:9510,host3:9510"/>

    To embed a Terracotta configuration file within the ehcache configuration, simply 
    place a normal Terracotta XML config within the <terracottaConfig> element.
    
    Example:
    <terracottaConfig>
        <tc-config>
            <servers>
                <server host="server1" name="s1"/>
                <server host="server2" name="s2"/>
            </servers>
            <clients>
                <logs>app/logs-%i</logs>
            </clients>           
        </tc-config>
    </terracottaConfig>
    
    For more information on the Terracotta configuration, see the Terracotta documentation.

    <terracottaConfig url="locahost:9510"/>

    <!--
    Cache configuration
    ===================

    The following attributes are required.

    name:
    Sets the name of the cache. This is used to identify the cache. It must be unique.

    maxElementsInMemory:
    Sets the maximum number of objects that will be created in memory

	maxElementsOnDisk:
    Sets the maximum number of objects that will be maintained in the DiskStore
	The default value is zero, meaning unlimited.

    eternal:
    Sets whether elements are eternal. If eternal,  timeouts are ignored and the
    element is never expired.

    overflowToDisk:
    Sets whether elements can overflow to disk when the memory store
    has reached the maxInMemory limit.

    The following attributes and elements are optional.

    timeToIdleSeconds:
    Sets the time to idle for an element before it expires.
    i.e. The maximum amount of time between accesses before an element expires
    Is only used if the element is not eternal.
    Optional attribute. A value of 0 means that an Element can idle for infinity.
    The default value is 0.

    timeToLiveSeconds:
    Sets the time to live for an element before it expires.
    i.e. The maximum time between creation time and when an element expires.
    Is only used if the element is not eternal.
    Optional attribute. A value of 0 means that and Element can live for infinity.
    The default value is 0.

    diskPersistent:
    Whether the disk store persists between restarts of the Virtual Machine.
    The default value is false.

    diskExpiryThreadIntervalSeconds:
    The number of seconds between runs of the disk expiry thread. The default value
    is 120 seconds.

    diskSpoolBufferSizeMB:
    This is the size to allocate the DiskStore for a spool buffer. Writes are made
    to this area and then asynchronously written to disk. The default size is 30MB.
    Each spool buffer is used only by its cache. If you get OutOfMemory errors consider
    lowering this value. To improve DiskStore performance consider increasing it. Trace level
    logging in the DiskStore will show if put back ups are occurring.

    clearOnFlush:
    whether the MemoryStore should be cleared when flush() is called on the cache.
    By default, this is true i.e. the MemoryStore is cleared.

    memoryStoreEvictionPolicy:
    Policy would be enforced upon reaching the maxElementsInMemory limit. Default
    policy is Least Recently Used (specified as LRU). Other policies available -
    First In First Out (specified as FIFO) and Less Frequently Used
    (specified as LFU)

    Cache elements can also contain sub elements which take the same format of a factory class
    and properties. Defined sub-elements are:

    * cacheEventListenerFactory - Enables registration of listeners for cache events, such as
      put, remove, update, and expire.

    * bootstrapCacheLoaderFactory - Specifies a BootstrapCacheLoader, which is called by a
      cache on initialisation to prepopulate itself.

    * cacheExtensionFactory - Specifies a CacheExtension, a generic mechansim to tie a class
      which holds a reference to a cache to the cache lifecycle.

    * cacheExceptionHandlerFactory - Specifies a CacheExceptionHandler, which is called when
      cache exceptions occur.

    * cacheLoaderFactory - Specifies a CacheLoader, which can be used both asynchronously and
      synchronously to load objects into a cache. More than one cacheLoaderFactory element
      can be added, in which case the loaders form a chain which are executed in order. If a
      loader returns null, the next in chain is called.
                                   
    Cache Exception Handling

    By default, most cache operations will propagate a runtime CacheException on failure. An
    interceptor, using a dynamic proxy, may be configured so that a CacheExceptionHandler can
    be configured to intercept Exceptions. Errors are not intercepted.

    It is configured as per the following example:

      <cacheExceptionHandlerFactory class="com.example.ExampleExceptionHandlerFactory"
                                      properties="logLevel=FINE"/>

    Caches with ExceptionHandling configured are not of type Cache, but are of type Ehcache only,
    and are not available using CacheManager.getCache(), but using CacheManager.getEhcache().


    Cache Loader

    A default CacheLoader may be set which loads objects into the cache through asynchronous and
    synchronous methods on Cache. This is different to the bootstrap cache loader, which is used
    only in distributed caching.

    It is configured as per the following example:

        <cacheLoaderFactory class="com.example.ExampleCacheLoaderFactory"
                                      properties="type=int,startCounter=10"/>

    Cache Extension

    CacheExtensions are a general purpose mechanism to allow generic extensions to a Cache.
    CacheExtensions are tied into the Cache lifecycle.

    CacheExtensions are created using the CacheExtensionFactory which has a
    <code>createCacheCacheExtension()</code> method which takes as a parameter a
    Cache and properties. It can thus call back into any public method on Cache, including, of
    course, the load methods.

    Extensions are added as per the following example:

         <cacheExtensionFactory class="com.example.FileWatchingCacheRefresherExtensionFactory"
                             properties="refreshIntervalMillis=18000, loaderTimeout=3000,
                                         flushPeriod=whatever, someOtherProperty=someValue ..."/>

    Terracotta Clustering 
    
    Cache elements can also contain information about whether the cache can be clustered with Terracotta.
    The <terracotta> sub-element has the following attributes:

    * clustered=true|false - indicates whether this cache should be clustered with Terracotta. By 
      default, if the <terracotta> element is included, clustered=true.
    * valueMode=serialization|identity - indicates whether this cache should be clustered with 
      serialized copies of the values or using Terracotta identity mode.  By default, values will
      be cached in serialization mode which is similar to other replicated Ehcache modes.  The identity
      mode is only available in certain Terracotta deployment scenarios and will maintain actual object
      identity of the keys and values across the cluster.  In this case, all users of a value retrieved from 
      the cache are using the same clustered value and must provide appropriate locking for any changes 
      made to the value (or objects referred to by the value).
    * coherentReads=true|false - indicates whether this cache should have coherent reads with guaranteed 
      consistency across the cluster.  By default, this setting is true.  If you set this property to 
      false, reads are allowed to check the local value without locking, possibly seeing stale values.  
      This is a performance optimization with weaker concurrency guarantees and should generally be used 
      with caches that contain read-only data or where the application can tolerate reading stale
      data.
    
    Simplest example to indicate clustering:
        <terracotta/>
        
    To indicate the cache should not be clustered (or remove the <terracotta> element altogether):    
        <terracotta clustered="false"/> 

    To indicate the cache should be clustered using identity mode:
        <terracotta clustered="true" valueMode="identity"/>
