Building from Source

*   Building Approach

    Ehcache is transitioning, slowly, from a full ant based build to a Maven build. At present ant is used
    to build, but using Maven Antlib for dependency resolution.

    The website and documentation are built using Maven.

    Because of the transition, the ant based ehcache build is in a sub-directory called core in the ehcache
    directory.

*   Building an ehcache distribution from source

    To build Ehcache from source:

    [[1]] Check the source out from the subversion repository.

    [[1]] Ensure you have a valid JAVA_HOME and ANT_HOME configured with binaries for both in your PATH

    [[1]] From within the ehcache/core directory, type <<<ant>>>


*   Running Tests for Ehcache

    To run the test suite for Ehcache:

    [[1]] Check the source out from the subversion repository.

    [[1]] Ensure you have a valid JAVA_HOME and ANT_HOME configured with binaries for both in your PATH

    [[1]] From within the ehcache/core directory, type <<<ant test>>>

    [[1]] If some performance tests fail, add a <<<-D net.sf.ehcache.speedAdjustmentFactor=x>>> System property to
            your command line, where x is how many times your machine is slower than the reference machine. Try setting
            it to 5 for a start.

*   Building the Site

    (These instructions are for project maintainers)

    You need the following unix utilities installed:

    * Maven 2.0.5

    * latex or tetex

    * ghostscript

    * pdftk

    * aptconvert

    * netpbm

    You also need a yDoc license.

    With all that, build the site as below:

---
    mvn site:site
---
