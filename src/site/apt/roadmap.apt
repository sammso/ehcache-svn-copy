Development Roadmap for 1.3

* Potential New Features

** SoftReferenceMemoryStore

 A MemoryStore built using SoftReferences. This would enable potentially much large MemoryStores with no risk of
 OutOfMemory errors.


** Element based expiry

 Allow elements to have override TTL and TTI settings. This would have a zero processing cost and would require
 two four byte ints to be added to Element.
