Logging And Debugging


* {Commons Logging}

    Ehcache uses the Apache Commons Logging library for logging.

    It acts as a thin bridge between
    logging statements in the code and logging infrastructure detected in
    the classpath. It will use in order of preference:

     * {log4j}

     * {JDK1.4 logging}

     * and then its own <<<{SimpleLog}>>>

     This enables ehcache to use logging infrastructures compatible with Java versions
    from JDK1.2 to JDK5. It does create a dependency on Apache Commons
    Logging, however many projects, including Hibernate, share the same
    dependency.

    For normal production use, use the <<<WARN>>> level in log4J
    and the <<<WARNING>>> level for JDK1.4 logging.

* Logging Philosophy

    Ehcache seeks to trade off informing production support developers or important messages
    and cluttering the log.

    {ERROR} (JDK logging SEVERE_ messages should not occur in normal production and indicate that action should be taken.

    {WARNING} (JDK logging WARN) messages generally indicate a configuration change should be made or an unusual event
    has occurred.

    {DEBUG} (JDK logging FINE) messages are for development use. All DEBUG level statements are surrounded with a guard
    so that they are not executed unless the level is DEBUG.

    Setting the logging level to DEBUG (JDK level FINE) should provide more information on the source of any problems.
    Many logging systems enable a logging level change to be made without restarting the application.


* {Network Monitoring for Distributed Caches}

    A simple new tool in ehcache-1.2, {ehcache-test.jar} can be used to debug replicated cache operations.

    It is invoked using:

--------------------------------------------

java -jar ehcache-test.jar path_to_ehcache.xml cacheToMonitor

--------------------------------------------

    It will print a configuration of the cache, including replication settings and monitor the number of elements
    in the cache. If you are not seeing replication in your application, run up this tool to see what is going on.

    It is a command line application, so it can easily be run from a terminal session.

    You can build the tool from source using the ant target <<<test-jar>>>. Copy the resultant ehcache-test.jar and
    your ehcache.xml configuration to the target machine.
