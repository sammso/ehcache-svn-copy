The JMS package provides replication across an ehcache cluster using a topic, and a JMSCacheLoader
    which provides a cache loader which loads from JMS using a queue.

External JMS clients may put things into a cache cluster by putting them on the topic. And external clients
    may respond to JMSCacheLoader requests.
