0.6 24 December 2008
====================

1. Upgrade to Glassfish V3 Prelude Embedded.
2. Added RMI JMXConnectorServer, exposing the platform MBeanServer which the server module is using to register ehcache mbeans.
3. Bundles the upgrade to 0.6 of Ehcache Server, with several improvements as follows:

   -    Register Ehcache core MBeans with the platform MBeanServer. This adds Ehcache JMX support
        to the web container, which can then be accessed by JMX consoles in the same way that the
        web container supports, which is normally exposing an RMI service URL. See the documentation
        for examples on how to use this with Tomcat and Glassfish.

   -    Upgrade Jersey to the 1.0 release. There are no behavioural changes.

   -    Cache resources now return a more complete representation showing configuration and statistics sub-elements.

   -    Added a DELETE cachename/* method to the API. Use this to clear the contents of a cache without removing
         the cache itself.

   -    Upgraded to ehcache-1.6-beta2.

0.5 15 October 2008
===================

1. Set the "application/octet-stream" mime type to uploads which do not set a MIME Type, rather than erroring out.
2. Add additional information to the cache element.


0.4 20 August 2008
==================

1. Fix bug where specifying the port in the command line is being ignored.

0.3 3 August 2008
=================

1. Fix bug in jsvc where it will not start on Java's that do not suppor -server
2. Upgrade cache server to 0.3. This version skips 0.2 so as to get in sync with the cache server releases.


0.1 18 July 2008
================

Initial version
