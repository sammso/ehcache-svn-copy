    This package contains JMX MBeans and implementations for management of ehcache.
    <p/>
    This implementation attempts to follow Sun's JMX best practices. See
    http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/core/mntr-mgmt/javamanagement/best-practices.jsp

  <p/>
  JMX was packaged with Java in JDK1.5. Keeping all JMX stuff in this package prevents leakage of JMX concepts
  so that JMX does not become a required dependency for ehcache.
  <p/>
  The package also enables a separation of concerns so that management does not get mixed with the implementation.
